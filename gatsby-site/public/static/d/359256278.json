The short stem invites the drinker to envelop the glass, bringing up the temperature in the beer, creating a fuller taste and allowing the body of the beer to be appreciated. A sloped lip on the top of the glass keeps the foam in tact and focuses the aromas.\n\n","price":500,"image":{"id":"ck709ttg29j0z0b753p87dxcg","url":"https://media.graphcms.com/evY0d1GSDC7DKILKVjFA"}},{"id":"ck6g2xtc4lcgl0b20xd8s5u2r","title":"Pubglass","description":"A pub glass is great for a variety of ales. Ales, like red wines, need a glass with a wide open mouth. The abundance of aromas can rise to the top to greet the drinker while the narrow bottom allows the glass to warm up slightly. Pub style glasses are an excellent partner to a stout.\n\n","price":456,"image":{"id":"ck709vjhk9jla0b75atkhxpw4","url":"https://media.graphcms.com/Us93jIroRSClVQ7y7Hap"}},{"id":"ck6g2yxkilchq0b20r1hbzhg9","title":"Hour glass","description":"An hourglass is a multi-dimensional glass. Tall and narrow, it also has a mouth that presents a variety of flavours and aromatics. Fill it with an amber lager or amber ale such as a honey brown and truly savour the great beer.\n\n","price":567,"image":{"id":"ck709wwzfzuqy0b203kpomxwz","url":"https://media.graphcms.com/sBwKTpGZTaw4Le26b5mX"}},{"id":"ck6g2zr7rlcil0b20o4dtpnvy","title":"Straight stein","description":"This proto-typical beer glass is wonderful for lighter tasting beers. It has a narrow mouth to concentrate the aromas at the top of the glass and a handle to avoid warming the beer up.\n\n","price":876,"image":{"id":"ck709y7p9zv9i0b200k4kd4yx","url":"https://media.graphcms.com/Fv5EizjeRiQXbOHGf4dx"}}]}}}
